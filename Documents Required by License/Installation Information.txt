To install this application~

First install Java, which can be found at https://java.com/en/download/

To run the application~

Execute Game at the command line, including libjcsi.jar in the classpath. (In Command Prompt, this should look something like: java -cp "libjcsi.jar;." Game)

If that doesn't work for some reason, you'll need to install the JDK and compile it yourself while including libjcsi.jar and this directory in the classpath.

Then execute Game while using the same classpath as above.

I have no ownership over the libjcsi library, which is covered under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

This is just a personal project I thought would be fun to do, and it's currently a work in progress (for example, I'm still fixing the Summoner class).
Don't expect stunning 4K graphics @60 fps :)
